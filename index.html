		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>
			I was born in Rochester, New York, and I currently live in Longwood, Florida. I got my Bachelor's of Fine Arts with a focus on painting in 2016 from the University of Florida. I have been interested in web development since a young age, and I am interested in advancing my skills and pursuing it as a career.

			I have technically seen seals before, but apparently I was too young to remember it. I hope to visit California in the near future to see elephant seals while they are hauled out. I am also a horror fan, one day I want to publish my own short horror stories, I just have to write them first. I have two cats: Xiomara and Parker. Their talents are bringing lizards in the house and being a lump, respectively.
